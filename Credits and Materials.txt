In the process of making this displaly (or is it a diorama?), I've been all over the Internet looking for solutions and help.  This is a list of pages/items/code that I used.

I will updare this often probably.  I'm susre I've foorgootten some things.

3D Files
==========

Building the 3D stl files was done using TinkerCad.

http://www.tinkercad.com

Original design and dimensions first started with WayGroovy's "Iron Man Hall of Armor".

Honeycomb side pattern remixed from ines.lopez's "panel"

Front Panel uses elemants from ZDP189's "NASA Apollo Mission Control Panels"

Code
=========

Code for the Raspberry Pi portion is programmed in Python 3.
https://www.python.org/

Code for the Raspberry Pi Pico is programmed for CircuitPython.  Please note that different boards require different versions of CircuitPython, so please read the instructions on their site to pick the right version.
